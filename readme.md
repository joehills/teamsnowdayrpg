Description
===========
This plugin is currently a set of custom post types and taxonomies for RPG development.

I am using it as a framework for an online version of the book Pitfalls and Penguins I helped write.

Roadmap
-------
Now that the custom post types and taxonomies have been generated, I plan to add:
1. Applicable custom meta boxes
2. Shortcodes to display applicable meta data
